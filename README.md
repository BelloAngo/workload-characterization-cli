# Workload Characterization CLI

A Python CLI tool powered by **Typer** that helps you analyze and simulate workload metrics for your growing platform. This tool is ideal for monitoring user behavior, system resource utilization, and planning for scaling effectively.

---

## Features

- **Session Duration:** Calculate the average duration of user sessions.
- **Inter-Arrival Time:** Measure the average time between consecutive sessions.
- **CPU Load:** Determine total CPU usage based on user activity.
- **Memory Load:** Estimate total memory usage for user requests.
- **Simulation:** Explore system behavior under different workload scenarios (`low`, `average`, or `peak`).

## Commands and Their Use Cases

### 1. **Session Duration**
**Command:**  
```bash
python workload_cli.py session-duration --total-duration <TOTAL_DURATION> --num-sessions <NUM_SESSIONS>
```

**What it calculates:**  
The average session duration across all user sessions.

**Use Case:**  
Useful for understanding how much time users spend per session, which is a key metric for evaluating user engagement.

---

### 2. **Inter-Arrival Time**
**Command:**  
```bash
python workload_cli.py inter-arrival-time --total-interval <TOTAL_INTERVAL> --num-intervals <NUM_INTERVALS>
```

**What it calculates:**  
The average time between the start of consecutive sessions.

**Use Case:**  
Helps in analyzing user arrival patterns and planning system responsiveness, such as predicting peak traffic periods.

---

### 3. **Total CPU Load**
**Command:**  
```bash
python workload_cli.py total-cpu-load --users <USERS> --requests-per-user <REQUESTS_PER_USER> --cpu-per-request <CPU_PER_REQUEST>
```

**What it calculates:**  
The total CPU load generated by active users.

**Use Case:**  
Essential for evaluating system performance and scaling CPU resources to handle user activity effectively.

---

### 4. **Total Memory Load**
**Command:**  
```bash
python workload_cli.py total-memory-load --users <USERS> --requests-per-user <REQUESTS_PER_USER> --memory-per-request <MEMORY_PER_REQUEST>
```

**What it calculates:**  
The total memory usage generated by user requests.

**Use Case:**  
Useful for estimating memory requirements to ensure your platform remains stable under heavy loads.

---

### 5. **Simulation**
**Command:**  
```bash
python workload_cli.py simulate --users <USERS> --requests-per-user <REQUESTS_PER_USER> --cpu-per-request <CPU_PER_REQUEST> --memory-per-request <MEMORY_PER_REQUEST> --simulation-scenario <low|average|peak>
```

**What it calculates:**  
Simulates CPU and memory load under different workload conditions:
- `low`: Represents light traffic (50% of average).
- `average`: Represents normal traffic (100%).
- `peak`: Represents heavy traffic (150%).

**Use Case:**  
Great for forecasting system behavior and planning infrastructure during peak usage times.

## Example Usage

1. **Calculate Session Duration**:
   ```bash
   python workload_cli.py session-duration --total-duration 500 --num-sessions 25
   ```
   Output: `Average session duration: 20.00 units`

2. **Simulate Peak Load**:
   ```bash
   python workload_cli.py simulate --users 300 --requests-per-user 20 --cpu-per-request 0.3 --memory-per-request 0.2 --simulation-scenario peak
   ```
   Output:  
   ```
   Simulation Scenario: Peak
     Total CPU Load: 2700.00 units
     Total Memory Load: 1800.00 units
   ```
